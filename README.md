## The Challenge

> The purpose of this challenge is to consume a public API and display the data in a grid-like way.

The API we will consume is the [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/). It is a public API that contains data about **1118** creatures from the worldwide famous franchise Pokémon, which was created in 1995 by Satoshi Tajiri.

For this challenge, most of the layout and mechanics are in place but we are still missing some TODOs.

In order to accomplish this challenge the following tasks must be made:

1. Implement The request that brings the list of Pokemons from the public API in the `src/pokemons/hooks/use-pokemon-list.js` hook.

2. On the screen fix the layout of each list item to display the text with the name of each Pokémon centralized horizontally and vertically.

This challenge must be done in 35 minutes.
